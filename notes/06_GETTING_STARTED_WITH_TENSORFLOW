This starts working with Tensorflow.

4 types of tensors:
- Constant: tf.constant()
- Variable: Add functionality to the graph for things like training parameters. must have a start value.
- Placeholder: Just there to hold the structure. They are put in place to later store a dynamic value needed by the graph.
- Sparse (advanced)

This course covers the Constant, Varialbe and Placeholder types.
